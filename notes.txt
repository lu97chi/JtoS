Notes from junior to senior course:
	Part 1 SSH.
	-is a secure shell protocol, is a way to comunicate computers over the internet, one computer to another.
	-command ssh <user>@<host>
	-copy files from computer to another computer via ssh using rsync -av . <username>@<host>:~foldername
	-ssh uses 3 tecniques, symmetrical encryption, asymmetrical encryption, hashing
	* symmetrical encryption:
		-uses one encryption key for both encryption and decryption.
		-if somenone has the key... something bad happend.
		-key exchange algorithm: the key is never trasmited trough the client and server
	* asymmetrical encryption:
		-uses two keys for encryption and decryption, one pair of public and one of private
		-private key can not be calculated mathematical by the public key
		-diffie hellman key exchange
	* hashing
		-it is not used to decrypt something
		-hmac 
	1-Diffie-Hellman key exchange
	2-Arrive at Symmetric key
	3-Make sure of no funny business
	4-Authenticate User
	-maybe password is not that secure as you could think...
	* How to generate a ssh key
		1- cd ~/.ssh
		2- ssh-keygen -C "lu97is@gmail.com" (check out what flags you can use)
		2.1 - ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
		3- only share .pub key
		4- copy the public key:
			1- pbcopy < ~(rootOfYourFile)
				if somehow doesnt work
			2- cat < ~(rootOfYourFile) (./ssh/<nameOfKey>
		5- add the public key to your server
		6- identify yourself 
			1- ssh-add ~/(rootOfYourFile)
	

	Part 2: Perfomance.
	-a 5mb image on a landing page is really necesary?
	-3 parts of optimization: front-request-backend 
	* request:
		"honey i shrunk the files"
		1.-Minimize text: Js, Css, Html, UglifyJS can do it, or webpack make it also
		2.-Format of images:
			 *Jpg are usually for photographs kinda big
			 *Gif for small animation
			 *Png limit the number of color kinda smaller than Jpg
			 *Svg vector graphics kinda small, good for retina and 4k
		"The traveling deliveryman"
		1.-less trips, maybe native is better
		2.-critical render path
	
do the what you missed...
